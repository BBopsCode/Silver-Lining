# Overview

Silver Lining is a mobile app that allows users to take photos, add captions, and view a feed of inspiring posts. The posts are stored locally, with mock posts included to simulate a live feed. This app aims to provide a positive, uplifting space for users to reflect on and share gratitude.

### How to Use the App:
1. Open the app to view a feed of inspiring posts.
2. Tap the floating action button to create a new post.
3. Take a photo using your device's camera and add a short caption.
4. Save the post to add it to your feed.
5. Navigate to your profile to view your personal collection of posts or clear them if needed.

### Purpose
I created this app to explore how social media can be used to promote gratitude instead of comparison. As a software engineer, this project deepens my understanding of React Native, Expo, and asynchronous data handling.
